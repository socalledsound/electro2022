# project final 

Ok folks, this is it!  Your best work.

Are there any requirements for the final project?

Heck yes.  It has to be amazing.  Ideally it should be something that you are very excited to spend a serious amount of time working on.  Maybe it's the reason that you signed up for this class, maybe it's a project that you've wanted to do for a while but haven't had the time/motivation to complete yet.  Maybe it's inspired by something that you learned in this course, or something that one of your peers made.  Whatever it is, I hope that you'll be proud of it!  And look forward to engaging with it.

But the main thing that it absolutely should be is....art.

And, I want you to approach these final projects as if they are artwork presented in a gallery.

This is a significant departure from previous projects in this class, which were very portable -- they could happen on any screen, anywhere, with a keyboard and mouse attached to it.

For this final project, I want you to think about how you can give a visitor to a gallery an interesting way to engage with a work of art.  

This might mean that they trigger a generative process with a motion sensor, or it might just mean that they engage with your work as a fullscreen projection, but I encourage you to explore the possibilities!  

We're going to be looking at various ways to integrate sensors and switches of all sorts -- beyond the ubiquitous mouse and keyboard -- into your sketches and experiences, over the next few weeks.

(But, I should add....this is not an absolute requirement.  If you want to just keyboard on, do so.  Just, do it well!)

Below are some examples of some neat projects, for inspiration.
