For your midterm, you should create a game.

But, what's a game?

Nearly anything can be a game!

And I encourage you to 'play' with this assignment to make something miraculous.

In the assignments that lead up to the midterm project, I'll be showing you how to make a game,
a bunch of games, actually, in javascript, and then show you how to wire up the CPE to be a game controller. We'll use the p5 library and also the p5.play library derived from it, and these games will be playable on the interwebs.

You can see some examples of these games, and games written in javascript, below.

Feel free to borrow or steal code or ideas from any of these games!

Whatever you make, there are a few things I want you to think about in this unit.

What is a hero? What is a villain, or enemy? And, what does it mean to make art that is a process?

Good luck, and have fun!
