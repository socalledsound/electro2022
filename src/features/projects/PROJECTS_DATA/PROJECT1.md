For this first project, you will record, gather, borrow, steal or find a collection of sounds and images.

You can record your own sounds using a zoom recorder or any other recording device, and any microphones that you want to use, including the contact mic that we will make in class. But...there is no need to record your own sounds if you don't want to! You can get sounds from <a href='https://freesound.org/'>freesound</a>, or any other place that you want to!

These sounds should be paired in some way with a set of images.  Again, these images can be 'yours', or borrowed. 

You can make a gallery of images with associated sounds; or a generative piece of some sort, that pairs them in unexpected ways, or something else more unexpected, it's totaly up to you.

You can make some sort of tool or instrument that lets people modify the images or sounds, or layer them together to make new compositions....it's totally up to you.

We'll be talking more about this as the first unit goes on, and hopefully I'll be able to give you some good inspiration!

And I'd love to help you! Just reach out in the discord forum. Or in class. Or by email.

Have fun out there and good luck!
