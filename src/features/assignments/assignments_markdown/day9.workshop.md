# breaking out

Today I want you to upload an animation to the gallery.  This might be your own take on the 'breakout' game, or it might be something else.
The important thing is: I want you to work with motion, and collisions, and state changes, so, the object or objects in your animation should change as the result of time passing, interactions with other elements on the page or some generative process you have running in the background, or user input.  In other words....an art game!
