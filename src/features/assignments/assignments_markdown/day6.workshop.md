# deep listening

For this assignment, I want you to do some deep listening, in the style of Pauline Oliveros.

Find a nice place, perhaps a quiet place, or perhaps not.  But it should be a place where you can sit and close your eyes for 10-15 minutes.

Meditate on the sounds as they come and go, experience them.

Do they have names?  Do they need to be named?  What do they mean?  How do you feel?  

Afterwards, write a few paragraphs about your experience, and take a photograph of the place.

Upload the photograph along with your written text to the gallery.
