# a bit about speakers and LEDs

Today, we're going to build some basic circuits. We'll learn how to use a multimeter and understand what it's telling us; how to wire up speakers; and how to set up a simple switch to turn an LED on and off on your CPE.

For your assignment I want you to dig through the examples and documentation on the makecode site and on the internets and come up with something fun -- of your own choosing -- to trigger on your CPE using the buttons and/or the touch sensors.

<!-- I'll give you a piezo disc in class. Be sure to hold onto it and be careful with it, we'll use it to make a contact mic next week. -->

You could also add a second (or third!) switch if you want to -- ! Really, the sky is the limit here, but don't make yourself crazy -- it's a marathon, not a sprint.
