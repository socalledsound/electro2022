In this assignment, we're going to make some enemies.  I mean, snake enemies.  I mean, enemies for our snake game.  These are going to be Autonomous Players; they'll move around on their own and semi kind of sort of chase our main player.  How much or how little they chase our Player is going to be pretty key to our game, because we want it to be challenging enough but not impossible.  So we'll have to develop some interesting behaviors for these Autonomous Players and I think it'll be a fun little dive into a very limited form of AI.  Let's get started.

### 1. AutonomousPlayer

The first thing we need is a new class of character, called an AutonomousPlayer.  I've saved you the trouble of writing/importing this, so we can focus on the behavioprs that we want to write, but I do want to mention a few nifty tricks here.


### 2. avoidWalls
