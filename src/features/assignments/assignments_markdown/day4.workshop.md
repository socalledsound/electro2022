For today's assignment, take a stab at presenting all or some of the images that you are/have assembled for your collection project.

You might present them as a grid, or as a sequence, or in some other amazing way or combination of ways.  It's really up to you.

The important thing is to try some ideas out, along the way to coming up with an amazing first project.
