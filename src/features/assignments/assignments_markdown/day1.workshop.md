### getting to know you

For this first assignment, I just want you to do two pretty simple things.

First, change the avatar that is currently your user image on the website, to an actual picture of yourself.

Please make it be a recognizable picture, I want to be able to associate your work with your face.

Second, click the submit assignment below and post an image of an artwork or project that you made. Add a description and a title and if you have a link or a link to a github repo where there's some code, that will be cool, too! But if no links or code, don't add them.

OK that's it! Check out the links for today and also the links for next class, over the weekend!
