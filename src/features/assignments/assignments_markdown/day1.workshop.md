### getting to know you

We'll go over this first assignment submission in class step by step, but here are the steps, in case you get lost.

Be sure to ask for help if you need it.

You should submit something before you leave class.

First, create a new user account on the course website.

Be sure to let me know if you have any trouble.

Next, change the avatar that is currently your user image on the website, to an actual picture of yourself.

Please make it be a recognizable picture, I want to be able to associate your work with your face. Please make the image file small! Something like 100kb would be awesome, but anything under 1MB should work. To get it smaller, you need to resize it, to maybe 400x400 pixels. It doesn't need to be big, or beautiful! There's a link on today's syllabus page to a video where I show you how to do this in the free Gimp image editing software.

Finally, use the online p5 editor that we used in class (there's link in the technical links!) and create a nice little something, anything you like. 

Submit your nice little something to the course website using the button below. 

You should make a screenshot of your work, and also submit a title, description, and a link to the p5 editor.

What you make doesn't have to be amazing, and you can always go back and change it later if you want.  But I want to make sure that everyone is set up to use the course site and is able to submit assignments before we leave today. I just want to make sure that everyone is getting comfortable with the tools that we'll use to make project 1 and that you're all able to navigate this website and to submit assignments!

Then, navigate to the gallery and see if your submission is there. You should also see it on your user status page (get to it by clicking the image of yourself in the header).

OK that's it! And be sure to check out the links for today and also the links for next class. Happy coding!
