### getting to know you

For this first assignment, I want you to do two things.

First, change the avatar that is currently your user image on the website, to an actual picture of yourself.

Please make it be a recognizable picture, I want to be able to associate your work with your face.

Second, use the make code editor that we talked about in class (there's link in the technical links!) nad create something, anything you like. You don't have to upload it to your cpe but you can if you want. Share/publish your code and then include the code link when you submit the assignment. If you like, you can change the image for this assignment to a screenshot of your code or an image of your cpe, or whatever you like. Really, I just want to make sure that everyone is able to submit assignments!

Then, navigate to the gallery and see if your submission is there. You should also see it on your user status page (get to it by clicking the image of yourself in the header).

OK that's it! Check out the links for today and also the links for next class, over the weekend!
