## day 6 : hardware

write us a quick status report of your progress on this first assignment. are you satisfied with your sounds? what is the organizing idea behind your collection of sounds? what would your ideal physical instrument look like? will you be able to implement this at this time? add any other thoughts you have about the assignment as it is unfolding for you! LASTLY -- think about the best way to document/present this project in the gallery for your project 1 assignment submission. Should you perform something on your instrument and record that as a video? Do you want to have someone else perform on your instrument? Be sure to think about how you would describe your instrument, if you were suddenly asked by, say, SFMOMA (or Google), to exhibit it. And, finish that first project before thursday!!!!!
