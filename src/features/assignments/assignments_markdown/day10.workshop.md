Today, we're going to build a super simplified version of Super Mario Bros.

We'll just have a Mario character and some coins, so it won't be that exciting, but I think it
will help introduce some pretty important concepts.

After we're done here, I want you to take this code skeleton and build on it to make your own thing, using the character that you've already created, and replacing the coins with something of your own invention. These can be good things or bad things, or things that are just things, the important thing is that your character be modified in some way by interacting with them.

Submit your code, a description and a screen shot at the link below.

Make sense? Ok then, let's get <a href='youtube link here'>started</a>!
