Ok, so now that we've looked a bit more at getting, analyzing and using pixel data from the camera, let's take that a step farther, and add some motion tracking to our pixel manipulation.

We're going to use a library called [clmtracker](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr). It's not a part of p5 or its libraries, but we can use it in conjunction with p5.

I've put together a [starter](https://github.com/socalledsound/clmtrackr-mask) sketch at github with the necessary files.

I want you to work your way through a few videos that I've put together on this library as an experiment, it should be pretty straightforward, you're just going to substitute your own image for the one that's there.

And that's it!

For the assignment I want you to use the clmtrackr library and create your own face filter, and then push your code to github and make it live using gh pages. You can get deeply into this or you can just make an image and use that as the material that the model places on your face. Watch the videos, ask questions, I think it'll make sense but if it doesn't, be sure to let me know!

Ok that's it for today! See if you can make your own 'face filter' and submit it in the gallery!

And if you're feeling really ambitious, see if you can implement some of the other effects available via clmtrackr in your own p5 sketch! Face deform is kind of cool. We'll also return to a lot of these ideas -- in a very new light -- when we get down to using shaders.
