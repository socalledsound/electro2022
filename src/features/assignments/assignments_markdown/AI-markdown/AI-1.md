making images with AI

I'm making this video in the fall of 2022 and this year, all of a sudden, everyone and I mean everyone is
talking about stable diffusion and dall-e and their ability to create interesting and realistic images
from text prompts.  


And all of a sudden AI is replacing artists and everyone is worried about it.
how did this happen?
it's been happening for a while now actually, these tools have been more or less freely available since 2021

imho it's kind of like no code websites -- they work for some people sometimes but AI isn't going to replace
designers, it's just going to make their jobs more interesting!

SO lety's look a little bit at the history of AI art.
