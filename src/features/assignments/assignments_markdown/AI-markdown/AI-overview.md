talk about conceptual art

so what the heck is AI art, actually?
(broad strokes)
neural networks

supervised learning:
classification
regression


reinforcement learning??

encoder/decorder networks

GAN
thispersondoesnotexist == stylegan 

start with noise - feed into NN --  another network grades whether it seems like a face or not

hard to train - hard to keep challenging the image generating network


DIFFUSION

add some noise until just noise

use stable diffusion to make images with prompts

embed text using gpt style transformer prompts
