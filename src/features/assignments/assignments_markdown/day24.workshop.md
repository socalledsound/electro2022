# r pi

Ok, so today we look at the raspberry pi, p5, gpio pins and the like.  

I've decided that for this, I'm going to use video, because a bunch of you aren't following the pi path.

Those that want to can follow these videos to get set up.  Or you can bookmark them and come back when you're ready.  Also, this will let me show you stuff rather than describe it.

You can also follow this [guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-getting-started/1) if you'd rather not watch a bunch of videos.

Today and Thursday I'll also meet with people about their final projects.

And, one thing I didn't show in that last video, was, installing updates, which can take a while.  If you're able to get your pi connected to wifi and all, then it will try to update all of the software, which will take an hour or so.

And here's a [link](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-raspberry-pi/) with instructions for installing node - from the terminal -- on your raspberry pi. 


You'll want node for installing johny pi and all kinds of other good things, like for instance npm install -ing the libraries in the examples for today.

Now, how do we get sketches onto the raspberry pi?  Obviously, you can write type them on the pi, there's a vs code version for linux and the rpi is linux.  But personally, I tend to write my sketches at my desk, and then upload them to github.  It's easy to download (and upload) them to your pi from github, using git, or just from the built in browser.  

You can install git by following these [instructions](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-git-on-raspberry-pi/).  FWIW sudo apt update might take a while, like updating the system does.

There's a default browser but you can also [install chrome](https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/google-chrome-for-raspberry-pi/), which I tend to use.

In the next few videos, I'm going to look at johny-five, and sockets.  Here's the [simple code](https://github.com/socalledsound/j5-simple) I'm looking at it in that video, and here's the [eyeball game code](https://github.com/socalledsound/eyeball_pi)
