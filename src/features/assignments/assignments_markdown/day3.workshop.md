### tiny bytes

Today we're going to get started with those cute little circuit playground express units that we have.

They're pretty fun! And they're pretty easy to get started with.

In today's lecture I talked about bits and bytes and I showed you a sort of binary color abacus that I made, using javascript.

I also talked a bit about logic and logic gates, and how they computers are basically a bunch of switches put together to construct logical systems.

Today, I want to

<!--

I'm going to show you how to do something similar today, but using the circuit playground express!

Along the way, you'll get familiar with variables, functions, if/then statements and loops in javascript. It's a lot for one day, especially if you're new to coding, but don't worry if it doesn't all make sense today, we'll be using these tools all semester and hopefully by the end of the semester you'll be a pro. -->
