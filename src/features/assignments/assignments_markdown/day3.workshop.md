### tiny bytes

Today we're going to get started in earnest with those cute little circuit playground express units that we have.

They're pretty fun! And they're pretty easy to get started with.

In today's lecture I talked about bits and bytes and I showed you a sort of binary color abacus that I made, using javascript.

I also talked a bit about logic and logic gates, and how they computers are basically a bunch of switches put together to construct logical systems.

In today's coding video, I'm going to play a bit with the idea of 'state', as it applies to interfaces. Go ahead and watch it now. After you've done so, I want you to use your CPE and write some code to create a dynamic interface, where the buttons we have available to us can fulfill more than one role, depending on the state of your device. That state should also be made clear to any user of the device, probably using the lights on the device.

If this seems over-complicated, I hope it won't after you watch todays videos!!! Submit your assignment at the button below. Be sure to describe what you're trying to do with your device and the process you went through to design and code the interface, in the description, and be sure to upload the code for your assignment along with an image or even video documentation. Have fun and happy coding!

I'm going to show you how to do something similar today, but using the circuit playground express!

Along the way, you'll get familiar with variables, functions, if/then statements and loops in javascript. It's a lot for one day, especially if you're new to coding, but don't worry if it doesn't all make sense today, we'll be using these tools all semester and hopefully by the end of the semester you'll be a pro. -->
