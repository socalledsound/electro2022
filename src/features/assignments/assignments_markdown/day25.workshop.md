# text input + chatting over sockets

As I mentioned last class, I'm not going to be writing any more big tutorials for you, I want you to focus on your projects at this point and I want to focus on helping you with your projects!

I did make a few videos for you, building a chat into the socket server game from last week.  I go over adding text input to a page and then handling that text input, outputting it to the screen and also sending it to all of the other clients.  You can follow along in my code, the current state of which is [here](https://github.com/socalledsound/sound-circle-server)!

And for your assignment submissions, I want you to post an update on your final project status.  And I'd really, really, really like it if you can have a working prototype before thanksgiving!!!
