# soundings

Now it's time to try incorporating sounds into your project.

Next class, we'll look at recording sounds, but for now, just see what you can find at freesound.org, or use sounds that you already have.

The sounds you use now might just be placeholders, but try experimenting.

You might have a sound that loops in the background, or you might have a sound that plays when images are clicked, or you might come up with something better.
