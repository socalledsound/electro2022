    time for our first crit!!!  be sure to come to class early!
   REMEMBER: crits are the days when you MUST be here, or you will lose a letter grade off your final grade for
   the course (for each crit day missed - yikes).
    
   Some important things to remember for crit: 
   1) if you are being critiqued, avoid explaining the piece before the audience experiences it.  The biggest value
   in critique is learning how they experience it, without you being there to explain it.  
   2) as an audience member, avoid asking questions as a form of critique.  make statements about how you experience 
   the work.
   3) be kind and be honest in your critiques.  Remember that the person presenting is a person, and make an 
   effort to see the work through their lens, as well as your own.
   4) on the flip side, if you are receiving a difficult crit, breathe deeply and remember that we care about you,
   and it's because we care that we are sharing.  
   5) relax, have fun, and enjoy the process.  with any luck, we'll become a community, and that will be nice.
