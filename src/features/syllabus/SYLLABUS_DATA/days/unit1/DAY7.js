    okay gang!  it's time for our first crit.  
    we're going to keep things light this first time around, and all play music together.
    bring your circuit playground sampler instrument to class and be ready to talk about
    your motivations for creating what you've made.
    First, I want everyone to lay their instruments out, and let people explore them at will.
    You should not try to color anyone's experience by explainning what it is or what it does!
    Or, if you do need to give instructions, print them out on a piece of paper.
    Strictly no talking!
    Then, we'll talk about that experience as a group for a while and discuss the sounds we heard and the experiences that
    we had.  Again, I want you to absolutely avoid discussing your own work, whether that be explaining, or defending or taking
    credit, or anything!  
    I'll be sure to leave some time at the end for you to make those responses if you still feel the need.
    Last, if we have time, we'll try a little group improv!
    BE SURE TO TAKE AT LEAST ONE PHOTOGRAPH TODAY AND ALSO A VIDEO, OF ANY LENGTH.  POST THEM TO THE GALLERY AS PART OF THIS ASSIGNMENT.
