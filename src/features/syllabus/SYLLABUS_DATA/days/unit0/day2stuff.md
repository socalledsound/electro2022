# all about circuits, speakers and LEDs

-- jim campbell + some speaker artists
-- projects with LED's
-- light emitting diode

-- what is electricity, what is a circuit
-- DC vs AC
-- can use a multimeter to measure volts
-- demonstrate a curcuit with a little speaker
-- circuit = loop. same voltage everywhere.  
-- if loop is broken then circuit stops
-- if loop is continuous bad things happen, it requires resistance
-- a speaker is a resistor
-- can use a multimeter to measure the resistance
-- can make the speaker coil go in or out by connecting volts

-- diode - light emitting diode

-- leds are built in to the cpe or you can hook them up to

-- resistors - measuring - color coding

led needs a resistor with it so that the LED doesn't get too much power and the ciKrcuit doesn't short circuit

KVL
Ohm's law

-- but how do we turn it on and off
-- a switch. close and open connection

-- build your own speaker project
