    Today we are going to step up our game a bit, literally, and talk about game STATE.
    Just like we previously realized that we can back out and up of our code to make a Coin class
    and a Mario class, we can back up and out even farther to make a Game.  We can store everything
    in the game world in there, and this means we will have a single source of truth for our game,
    which is always deeply satisfying.  Watch the vids and come to class for more on this very big topic.

    discussionQuestions: [
        `What is 'state' and why is it good to have a 'single source of truth'?`,
        `Give some examples of ways we can manage state in javascript.`,
        `Why is it nice or good to have a 'Game' object?`,
        `What is 'refactoring'?  What are some signs that you need to think about it?`,
