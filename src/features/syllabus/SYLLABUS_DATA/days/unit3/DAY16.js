        Today we're going to return to LEDs, but we're going to apply what we've been learning.
        We'll learn about addressing our neopixels, and some interesting ways to use them in lieu of a monitor. 
        I'm also going to demonstrate some of the neat things that are possible with a raspberry pi.
        Maybe you bought one, maybe you will after today.  Or maybe it's just a nice thing to know about.
        However which way you slice it, it's what we're going to be talking about for a few days!
