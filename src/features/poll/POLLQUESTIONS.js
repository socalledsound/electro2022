        question: 
            `I find myself wondering if it would make more sense to NOT have an official project 3.
            A) because people seem kind of stressed/behind this year;
            B) because it would give you more time to focus on your final project and
            C) because project 3 often feels a little rushed, squeezed in between the midterm and the final.
            So I guess the question is, should we remove that weight?
            The things you're learning now will almost surely be useful to you in your final 
            project, but rather than have the weight of a 'project' and a 'crit', we can just 
            do these as assignment submissions, provided that everyone commit to having a final project
            proposal to submit in the gallery by November 4?
