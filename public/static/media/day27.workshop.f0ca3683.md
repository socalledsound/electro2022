<!-- # firebase with p5

Ok!  So last time we built a [drag and drop image gallery](https://persistently-4625f.web.app/).  Today we're going to [snazz it up](https://new-image-gallery.web.app/) a little bit by bringing those images into p5.  My hope is that this give you the tools you need to bring these technologies together in all kinds of exciting ways, if not for your final projects, then hopefully for something on down the road.

I've put together a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHJTpoJkSrePa9gCcRqmRwbYnFNxmPTtZ) for you on youtube that will hopefully be reasonably easy to follow along with.

And also a few starter sketches.

If you managed to build your own gallery successfully, great!  If not, then you can start [here](https://github.com/socalledsound/new-image-gallery/tree/04-deployed) and just add your own firebase config file.

The p5 sketch that we'll bring in to this app is [here](https://github.com/socalledsound/webgl-image-gallery).

The finished project with integrated p5 sketch is [here](https://github.com/socalledsound/new-image-gallery/tree/07-finished).

In every case you will need to bring your own firebase config, which I go over in [video 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaazEphXf5A&list=PLHJTpoJkSrePa9gCcRqmRwbYnFNxmPTtZ&index=4) of the series.

Happy coding!  Let me know how it goes, or if you need any help.

At the assignment submission link, please submit your FINAL PROJECT!

And as always, let me know if you need any help with that.

It's been tremendously fun working with all of you this semester and I hope that you'll stay in touch!  I'm thinking about doing a regular coding thing, even after class ends, and will let you know in an email if and when I find a weekly time when that will work well.  Send me an email if you're interested and prefer a specific time and I'll figure that in.  There's so much that we haven't covered in this class, that's always the way.  But I hope you've learned something and are inspired to continue learning.  Feel free to reach out at any time if you get stuck with a project and think I might be able to help.

Sincerely yours,
ck
