### getting to know you

For this first assignment, I want you to do two things.

First, change the avatar that is currently your user image on the website, to an actual picture of yourself.

Please make it be a recognizable picture, I want to be able to associate your work with your face. Please make the image file small! Something like 100kb would be awesome, but anything under 1MB should work. To get it smaller, you need to resize it, to maybe 400x400 pixels. It doesn't need to be big, or beautiful! There's a link on today's syllabus page to a video where I show you how to do this in the free Gimp image editing software.

Second, use the make code editor that we talked about in class (there's link in the technical links!) and create something, anything you like. If the interface or the process doesn't make sense, there's also a link on today's syllabus that explores how to use the makecode editor in great depth. You don't have to upload it to your cpe but you can if you want.

Share/publish your code on the makecode site and then include the code link when you submit the assignment from the button below. For this assignment, just go ahead and leave the default image, which should be the image of your face that you uploaded in part 1!

Really, with this assignment I just want to make sure that everyone is getting comfortable with the tools that we'll use to make project 1 and that you're all able to navigate this website and to submit assignments!

Then, navigate to the gallery and see if your submission is there. You should also see it on your user status page (get to it by clicking the image of yourself in the header).

OK that's it! Check out the links for today and also the links for next class, over the weekend. Happy coding!
