For this first project, you will record, gather, borrow, steal or find a collection of sounds.

You can record your own sounds using a zoom recorder or any other recording device, and any microphones that you want to use, including the contact mic that we will make in class. But...there is no need to record your own sounds if you don't want to! You can get sounds from <a href='https://freesound.org/'>freesound</a>, or any other place that you want to!

What is absolutely essential is that you take seven sounds -- one for each capacitive touch sensor on the Circuit Playground Express, and convert them into a format that the CPE can work with, which means 16 bit mono .wav files, at 22050 khz sampling rate.

Then, you need to load some python code onto that CPE that will allow us to trigger those sounds by touching the capacitive touch sensors of the CPE.

Now, this is just a blueprint -- you can extend this project in all kinds of ways!

Perhaps you want to trigger not just one sound at the touch of a button, but some combination of sounds? You can set that up in your code!

Perhaps you want to incorporate a motion sensor, or the built in accelerometer or the temperature sensor?

All of these things can be done.

And I'd love to help you! Just reach out in the discord forum. Or in class. Or by email.

Have fun out there and good luck!
