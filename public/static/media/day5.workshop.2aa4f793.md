# loops and arrays

For this assignment I want you to explore arrays, and navigating them using for loops.

I showed you how to store values -- including color values in arrays.

I also showed you a few different ways to loop over those arrays to generate patterns.

And, I also showed you how to set up event listeners, and store THOSE in arrays.

And I ALSO mentioned how frustrated I am that the make code javascript library has no ability to load sound files, sadly.

Now, wouldn't it be amazing if this assignment could be you, using arrays to store sound files? And then, using arrays to store event listeners and trigger them? And then you could upload your a virtual version of your first project this weekend?

That was my original plan! But, sadly.

Now, the good news is, we're going to be able to do that on our CPE, but in Python. I don't think it will be that hard for you to take these ideas and apply them in Python. I've already shared that code with you and gone over how to get it installed and working on your CPE. Which we will do next week.

But we can't share that here. And...I love javascript, we're going to be using arrays a TON in all of our work the rest of the semester, so for this assignment, get in there and play with arrays and colors and the sounds they provide you, and make some interesting light animations with sounds and lights in the make code editor! And share it in the gallery.

And if you are feeling ambitious, or already know a little python, take a stab at loading your sounds onto your CPE!

And, either way, be sure to bring your sounds and your CPE on tuesday. I want to guide you through the Python code installation process and see if we can get each and every one of your CPEs singing, then!
