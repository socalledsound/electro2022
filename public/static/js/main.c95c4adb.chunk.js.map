unit we will learn some things about storing and manipulating data but also spend a good ammount of time \n    thinking about why we should do this, and explore various approaches to organizing and presenting collections.  \n    Most importantly, we'll discuss how to introduce just enough fuckery to keep things spicy and fun.  \n    We'll look at the work of a wide range of artists who have tackled these problems in interesting ways: \n    Eva Hesse, Agnes Martin, Francis Alys, Joseph Kosuth and, of course, Iggy Azalea.   \n    And many others  .

We create, by playing.\n    In this unit we'll be thinking about systems -- generative compositions which unfold in time -- such as animations and video games.\n    I'm taking the famous 'Goldberg Machines', or 'Pitagoru Suitchi', as they're called in Japan,\n     as inspiration for this unit, not just because those machines are senesless and wonderful, but also because they are \n     processes.  We'll be focusing on artworks that are processes in this unit, and I hope what you learn here will cause \n     you to look at all kinds of work differently.  We'll also switch gears slightly, and move our attention to the \n     javascript in its native context, the web.  \n    You're probably familiar with a 'rube goldberg' machine, where the main character of a cartoon wakes up, stumbles out of bed,\n    and without doing anything at all, gets their teeth brushed and finds himself sitting at a table with breakfast and a cup of coffee in\n    front of them.  \n    In a lot of ways, these imaginary machines are the playful precursors to today's robotics startups.\n    We're going to try to make our own playful versions of Goldberg machines in this unit, \n    using javascript.  These can be games, with scores and treasure chests and all the rest, \n    or they can just be abstract playful interactions.  If you want to, you can even make physical, real-world\n    machines.  \n    And I will be showing you how to use your CPE to control your games, if they're written in p5!\n    So you can use things like an accelerometer, microphone input, or the touch sensitive buttons to control a screen. \n    The key thing is, you must make a repeatable process, that unfolds in time  More details after the click.  \n    `,\n    project: MIDTERM_PROJECT,\n    days: [DAY9, DAY10, DAY11, DAY12, DAY13, DAY14, DAY15, DAY16]\n}\n\nexport const UNIT3 = {\n    id: 103,\n    title: 'unit 3 : circuit playground',\n    unit: 'unit3',\n    illustrationURL: UNIT2LOGO,\n    // illustrationURL: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/chris-kubick/image/upload/v1597869667/side-effects/Untitled_xko40r.png',\n    overview: `\n        In this unit we are going to take some of the things that we learned in unit 2 and apply them to the realm of user input.\n       Where before we were able to take in some input from a button, and output it to an led to tell us what the value of that input was;\n       now we will take in streams of data and similarly output streams of data.
